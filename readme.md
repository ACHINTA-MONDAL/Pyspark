# account_config.ini Configuration File

## Overview
The `account_config.ini` file is structured to provide necessary configurations for different roles and API interactions within an AWS environment. Each section in the file is preceded by a comment explaining its purpose.

## Sections

### Account
This section contains the AWS account ID, which is essential for identifying the account within AWS services. Replace the placeholder with your actual account ID.

```ini
[account]
id = <your_account_id_here>
```

### Region
Specifies the AWS region where your resources are located. Replace with your desired AWS region.

```ini
[region]
name = eu-west-1
```

### S3 Direct
Configuration related to the S3 direct upload product. Use a group name that has access to the specified account.

```ini
[s3_direct]
# Configuration for S3 direct upload
```

### API
Contains the settings for API interactions. It includes endpoints for triggering compute frameworks and getting job statuses.

```ini
[api]
# API settings and endpoints
```

### Timeout and Interval Settings
Defines the script timeout and the interval for API queries to determine if a job has been successful on the cloud.

```ini
[timeout]
script_timeout = 300

[interval]
query_interval = 10
```

## Usage
Each configuration block should be updated with your specific information before using the `account_config.ini` file.

For `s3_direct` and `api` sections, follow the instructions in the comments to retrieve the correct endpoint URLs and other related configurations.

Ensure the `timeout` and `interval` sections are set to values that align with your operational requirements.

When creating your `README.md`, you can expand on each section with more details as necessary, providing additional context or instructions on how to find and set the values needed.
