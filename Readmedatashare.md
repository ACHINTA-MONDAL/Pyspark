Here's a comprehensive document covering Redshift Datashares.

**Redshift Datashares**

**1. What is a Datashare?**

* Amazon Redshift datashares are a feature allowing secure and seamless sharing of live data across Redshift clusters.  
* This enables data access without the need for complex ETL processes or data duplication. 
* Datashares are especially valuable in scenarios where different teams or organizations require access to a central data source.

**2. Types of Redshift Datashares**

* **Intra-Account Datashares:** Sharing of data between Redshift clusters within the same AWS account.
* **Cross-Account Datashares (Preview):** Sharing of data between Redshift clusters in different AWS accounts.

**3. SQL Statements for Creating and Managing Datashares**

**Producer Cluster (where data originates):**

* **CREATE DATASHARE:**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATASHARE <datashare_name>;
   ```
* **Add objects to the datashare:**
   ```sql
   ALTER DATASHARE <datashare_name> ADD SCHEMA <schema_name>;
   ALTER DATASHARE <datashare_name> ADD TABLE <schema_name>.<table_name>; 
   ```
* **Grant access to a consumer:**
   ```sql
   GRANT USAGE ON DATASHARE <datashare_name> TO NAMESPACE <consumer_namespace>;
   ```

**Consumer Cluster (where data is accessed):**

* **Create a database from a datashare:**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE <database_name> FROM DATASHARE <datashare_name> NAMESPACE <producer_namespace>;
   ```

**4. Cost Structure of Datashares**

* **Producer Cluster:**
   * Charged based on the amount of data scanned on the producer cluster when a consumer cluster queries the shared data.
* **Consumer Cluster:**
    * Incurs standard query processing costs on the consumer side. There are no additional charges directly related to datashares.

**5. Limitations of Redshift Datashares**

* **Data Modifications:** Consumers have read-only access by default. Write access is currently in preview.
* **Object Types:**  Not all object types are supported (e.g., stored procedures).
* **Regions:** Cross-account data sharing might be limited to specific regions.

**6. Redshift Datashare Auto Schema Update Strategy**

* Redshift does not automatically propagate schema changes from the producer to the consumer.
* **Strategies to manage schema updates:**
    * **Manual Updates:** Consumers need to manually update their database objects to reflect producer-side changes.
    * **Coordination:** Establish a process to communicate schema updates from the producer to consumers. 
    * **Tooling:** Consider developing scripts or tools to automate the update process.

**Important Considerations**

* Redshift datashares offer a powerful data sharing mechanism, but their effective use requires careful planning around cost optimization, schema management, and potential limitations.
* Assess your data sharing needs and the complexity of your data models before wide-scale implementation.
